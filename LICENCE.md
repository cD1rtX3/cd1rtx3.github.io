## Preamble ##
It should be the right of the users of a software to decide what they do with
that software.  If it does not cause harm to other users, it should be entirely
allowed.  This includes software modifications.

If a user or group of users make an interesting and unique modification to a
game, they should be able to share it with the world unhindered.  If a user or
group of users find a way to optimize a slow software, they should be able to
share the optimized software, as opposed to sharing the hoops that they jumped
through to optimize the software.  Software use should be in the hands of the
users of the software.
